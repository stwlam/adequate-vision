# Adequate Vision

Serviceable vision management for dnd5e

## The Module

This module does two things:

1. Replaces the core darkvision mode with one that has fewer unwelcome visual surprises and is more in tune with dnd5e rules.

2. Includes a setting to link each PC token's vision and detection modes with its corresponding actor's senses. This is currently in testing, but it makes no server updates. I suggest this be used with a global illumination threshold at a point where you deem "darkness" to end.

Try it, and if you don't like it, disable the setting to undo all the changes made. Send feedback if you have suggestions on how it should work.

## Usage Instructions

1. Enable module.

2. Set a token to have darkvision or enable "Link Actor Senses" setting.

    2a. If the setting is disabled and token darvision is already set prior to enabling this module, set each applicable token's vision mode to something else and back to darkvision. This will reset the defaults.
