# Adequate Vision

Serviceable vision management for dnd5e

## How It Works

This module replaces some core vision and detection modes with ones that have fewer unwelcome visual surprises and is more in tune with dnd5e rules:
- Dim lighting outside an a token's darkvision range won't be rendered with higher brightness.
- If an invisible token stands in darkness, darkvision or a similar sense will be necessary to see it.
- Vision/detection modes have been added to support blindsight, truesight, and Devil's Sight.

Additionally, it includes a setting ("Link Actor Senses") to link each token's vision and detection modes with its corresponding actor's senses. For greater convenience, consider using this setting with a global illumination threshold at a point where you deem "darkness" to end (e.g., 0.75 darkness).

No server updates are made with the "Link Actor Senses" setting. Try it, and if you don't like it, disable the setting to undo all the changes made. The vision and detection modes will still be available with the setting disabled.

## End of Life Notice

Adequate Vision will not be updated for Foundry V11 compatibility, but it will stick around for those not wanting to immediately upgrade to V10. For V11, I recommend using [Vision/Detection Modes 5e](https://github.com/dev7355608/vision-5e) by dev7355608 (also the author of [Perfect Vision](https://github.com/dev7355608/perfect-vision)).
