Serviceable vision management for dnd5e

## How It Works

This module replaces the core darkvision mode with one that has fewer unwelcome visual surprises and is more in tune with dnd5e rules. It also adds a "devil's sight" vision mode and blindsight detection mode.

Additionally, it includes a setting ("Link Actor Senses") to link each PC token's vision and detection modes with its corresponding actor's senses. For greater convenience, consider using this setting with a global illumination threshold at a point where you deem "darkness" to end (e.g., 0.75 darkness).

No server updates are made with the "Link Actor Senses" setting. Try it, and if you don't like it, disable the setting to undo all the changes made. The vision and detection modes will still be available with the setting disabled.
