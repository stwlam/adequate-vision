# Adequate Vision

Serviceable vision management for dnd5e

## The Module

This module does three things:

1. Replaces the core darkvision mode with one that has fewer unwelcome visual surprises and is more in tune with dnd5e rules.

2. Adds a rudimentary "devil's sight" vision mode.

3. Includes a setting to link each PC token's vision and detection modes with its corresponding actor's senses. This is currently in testing, but it makes no server updates. For greater convenience, consider using this setting with a global illumination threshold at a point where you deem "darkness" to end.

Try it, and if you don't like it, disable the setting to undo all the changes made. Send feedback if you have suggestions on how it should work.

## Usage Instructions

1. Enable the module.

2. Set a token to have darkvision/devil's sight. For a hands-free experience, enable the "Link Actor Senses" setting.
